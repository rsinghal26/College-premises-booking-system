# College-premises-booking-system
The college premises booking is basically for simplifying the booking process of LT (lecture theatres), labs, and SAC(sports activity complex) in the college.The app automates the booking process which is a time consuming process if done manually because we have to fill 2-3 forms before getting the LT booked. Also it helps to reduce the paperwork and keeping the records for each entry.Many times the lab instructor is unavailable so we have to visit his office 2-3 times before actually getting the LT or lab booked.The app will be helpful to all the students,faculty and also to the lab instructor or the person who is in charge for the doing thebooking work.
